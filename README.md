# Chin et al. 2022 Fishery Bulletin
Data associated with Chin et al. 2022. "Life history differences between two anadromous northern Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma malma) populations in Bristol Bay, southwestern Alaska." Fishery Bulletin.

We include the life history datasheet (Dolly Varden_LH_data_FB.csv) for northern Dolly Varden fromn the Nushagak and Egegik districts of Bristol Bay in southwestern Alaska, just north of the Alaskan Peninsula. Hopefully this dataset will facilitate more life history data sharing on char and other salmonids.

Note that metadata are included (Dolly Varden_LH_metadata_FB.csv).
