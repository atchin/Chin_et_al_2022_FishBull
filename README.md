# Chin et al. 2022 Fishery Bulletin
Data associated with Chin et al. 2022. "Life history differences between two anadromous northern Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma malma) populations in Bristol Bay, southwestern Alaska." Fishery Bulletin.

We include the life history datasheet (Dolly Varden_LH_data_FB.csv) for northern Dolly Varden fromn the Nushagak and Egegik districts of Bristol Bay in southwestern Alaska, just north of the Alaskan Peninsula. Hopefully this dataset will facilitate more life history data sharing on char and other salmonids.

We also include the microchemical data from Dolly Varden otoliths from specimens caught from the Nushagak Commercial Salmon Fishing District on June 25, 2018. Due to lab time limitations, otoliths were ablated into different sessions. The folders include the NIST standards used for each laser-ablation session, which are standardized against a known NIST concentration and then applied to the element ratios within the otoliths themselves.

Specific code on analyzing this data is forthcoming.

Note that metadata are included (Dolly Varden_LH_metadata_FB.csv).
