# Chin et al. 2022 Fishery Bulletin
Data associated with Chin et al. 2022. ["Life history differences between 2 anadromous populations of the northern form of the Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma malma) in Bristol Bay in southwestern Alaska."](https://spo.nmfs.noaa.gov/content/life-history-differences-between-2-anadromous-populations-northern-form-dolly-varden) Fishery Bulletin.

We include the life history datasheet (Dolly Varden_LH_data_FB.csv) for northern Dolly Varden fromn the Nushagak and Egegik districts of Bristol Bay in southwestern Alaska, just north of the Alaskan Peninsula. Hopefully this dataset will facilitate more life history data sharing on char and other salmonids.

We also include the microchemical data from Dolly Varden otoliths from specimens caught from the Nushagak Commercial Salmon Fishing District on June 25, 2018. Due to lab time limitations, otoliths were ablated into different sessions. Each folder is named as such (session1, etc.). The folders include the NIST standards and corresponding otoliths that were analyzed during that session.

Specific code on analyzing this data is forthcoming.

Note that metadata are included (Dolly Varden_LH_metadata_FB.csv).
